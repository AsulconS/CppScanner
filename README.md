# CppScanner
CppScanner is a C++ based Web Application for scanning images from photographs, in which we use the Harris method to detect the corners of an image. From the corners, we obtain the necessary points to apply a homography (or projective transformation) to the image, so that we can have a framed and correctly aligned image.
